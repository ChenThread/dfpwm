Dynamic Filter Pulse Width Modulation

codec was made back in 2012

designed as a voice codec

challenge: write a good, 1-bit-per-sample codec

***
*** slide 1
***

this is our example waveform

objective: encode it in some 1-bit form

***
*** slide 2
***

this is 1-bit Pulse Code Modulation (or PCM for short)

it's the most obvious solution

it's also really bad quality

fortunately, there's a fairly easy way to get better quality, and that is to have something you can muffle

***
*** slide 3
***

this is pretty much Pulse Width Modulation (or PWM for short)

it works great at 1MHz

but if you're using a frequency that high, you might as well just use CD quality PCM instead

how can we improve this?

we can change the strength of the low pass filter

* when we find ourselves constantly going up and down, we tighten the filter so we can pretty much land where we want
* when we find ourselves going in a single direction, we loosen the filter so we can move to where we want quickly

if you look at the lower left you'll notice the waveform doesn't quite up, so keep watching that...

***
*** slide 4
***

this is DFPWM in its rawest form, and how the predictor sees it

the first thing you'll notice is the improvement at that point

just kidding, the first thing you notice is that there's a lot more noise as it leaves

but at least we have an improvement in one place

this makes an irritating carrier whine so we have to dampen it

we do a check

* If the last direction was the same as the current direction, give the output unmodified
* Otherwise, output the average of the last raw output and the current raw output

it's far from perfect and can definitely be improved on but it does help, as you will see here:

***
*** slide 5
***

the carrier whine is reduced and you get something closer to the waveform.

there's still enough of a whine to be annoying though, so what do we do to dull annoying high pitched things?

we send them to school!

well OK, what we really do is put in a low-pass filter, like so

***
*** slide 6
***

and there we have it, pretty good 1-bit audio.

notice the peak on the top-left - that's just the codec warming up to the right filter strength

while we could seed it with the right filter strength beforehand, you really aren't going to notice the warmup.

looking at any of the other peaks or troughs will give a fairer comparison.

just quickly go back to slide 3

it's noisy in the middle and the peaks and troughs aren't very smooth

and then back to slide 6

and it's pretty good.

while i hope this talk informed you, i have to be realistic and admit i probably confused the hell out of you

but as long as you enjoyed the pretty pictures, i'm happy.
